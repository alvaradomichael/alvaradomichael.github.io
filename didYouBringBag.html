<h1>Did you bring a resusable bag?</h1>
<p>Some estimates suggest that purchasing a single set of reusable shopping bags and using them every time you go shopping could eliminate the disposal of as many as 20,000 disposable plastic bags. If you get quality cloth shopping bags, you'll be able to reuse them for years to come.

Making plastic shopping bags requires the burning of fossil fuels, the cutting down of trees and, in some cases, the use of unfair labor practices. Reusable bags save both flora and fauna, and help cut down on the emission of dangerous greenhouse gases.</p>
